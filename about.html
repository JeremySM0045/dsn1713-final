              </h1>
              <p class="">
                Golden Triangle Signs is located in the Ottawa area serving Ottawa and the valley including Richmond, Stittsville, Carleton Place, Smiths Falls, Brockville, Kingston, Almonte, Pakenham, Arnprior,  and Eastern Ontario, including Metcalfe, Manotick, Orleans, to name only a few.  We are a family owned business that has been signing our customers’ success for over 35 years. The first impression a customer gets of your business location is from the signs and overall appearance. Professional signage will draw attention and portray your business image. The signs should reflect what the customer will experience when they walk through the door.  We like to call your signage the Silent Salesman as it is there 24/7 showing the world who you are and what you do.

                There is a reason that big franchise businesses spend a great amount of money on their signs and buildings. Even small businesses can achieve similar results by making sure their building signs are professionally done and represent what service or product line they are offering.   Their cube vans, sales vehicles and service vans or whatever vehicles they are using are branded as well.  Vehicle graphics or vehicle wraps are a popular way to make their company stand out 24 hours a day seven days a week.  Magnetic signs are a great way to be able to advertise when you want and not advertise when you dont want to….promotional items like fridge magnets keep your name in the household, in the kitchen, on the fridge….holding a masterpiece of artwork created by a loved one usually. With cost-effective full colour printing available on various substrates, including alupanel, plywood, lexan, plexiglass to name a few  you can have polished and professional looking signs with your logo and business represented at really reasonable prices.  Heritage style signage is very popular among some of the tourist spots like Westport and Merrickville or Balderson.
